# Sextant_Revisited
Invented graphical form of my "HOME COMING TABLE" aka KOTIINPALUUTAULU from 1990. Except this works for ever.

When coming home, you observe the angle of the sun. And when the sun is higher than the table, you
move away from the sun and vice versa. If it is the same, you just just wait. If you have to wait all day,
you are home. 

Accuracy easily 10 kilometers. As one degree is 60 mautical miles.

Written in brand new Python-Nokolisp. Sorry about that.

Summertime is hereby cancelled. Wonkiness at the end of february is because correct daycount is not observed. Does not affect the
results, however.
